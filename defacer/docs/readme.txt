ATENTION, if you are NOT using xoops 2.4 or impressCms 1.1
you have to add a line in header.php and footer.php at the root of your instalation

In yoursite/header.php paste the line

@include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH . '/modules/defacer/include/beforeheader.php';

right after

defined("XOOPS_ROOT_PATH") || die("XOOPS root path not defined");

In yoursite/footer.php paste the line

@include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH . '/modules/defacer/include/beforefooter.php';

Tips
=======
When creating pages you can use '*' symbol in the url field to match any url.

You should use relative paths
If you select news module your path will be related to yoursite/module/news/
You should add for example
index.php and not modules/news/index.php

System module is relative to root
You can select system module and enter this url to cover all userinfo pages:
userinfo.php*

Tips for blocks anywhere (xoops 2.4 only)
=========
Just prefix your block title with an underscore and you will be able to use it
has a smarty variable inside your theme or template
Example:
-Edit User menu block and rename it to _User Menu
-Take notice of the "bid" in the url, in this case it is '1':
    modules/system/admin.php?fct=blocksadmin&op=edit&bid=1
-Usage on theme/template:
<{$xoops_block_1.title}> --> echos User Menu
<{$xoops_block_1.content}> --> echos the block content

Limitations
========

The block for changing themes is deactivated when using Defacer Theme Changer.
